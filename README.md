celltracker
===========

A set of tools to track fluorescently tagged bacterial cells.

Just copy celltracker.py into the folder containing the fluorescence image to process and run the script by issuing 'python celltracker.py' from the Terminal.

To run the celltracking algorithm, you need to have the following installed on your computer:

* numpy - http://numpy.scipy.org/
* scipy - http://scipy.org/
* OpenCV - http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
* matplotlib - http://matplotlib.org/
* hungarian 0.2.3 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hungarian 
* Polygon2 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Polygon/2.0.4

Most of those can be installed through pip.


I've included 100 TIFs in a zip file under example/celltrackFigs.zip to test the tracking suite.
